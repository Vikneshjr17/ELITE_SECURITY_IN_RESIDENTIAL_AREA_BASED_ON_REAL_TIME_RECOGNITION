# ELITE_SECURITY_IN_RESIDENTIAL_AREA_BASED_ON_REAL_TIME_RECOGNITION

Elite Security is a security mobile application based in Real Time Recognition that is made for 
residential areas. It is presented in a mobile application whereas the security, communication, 
and convenience of neighbourhoods will be enhanced. This system will have the faces and car 
plates of the residents registered with their respective visitors. Then, only the faces and car 
plates enrolled in the system can pass through security guards. This ensures that the residential 
area is exclusively for authorised and verified residents.
This Elite Security can definitely decrease the number of crimes happening in the 
residential area. Other than that, the mistakes and errors that happen during the handling of 
manual processes can also be lessened by implementing this tight security system. Most 
importantly, no more incidents of unauthorised access card duplication will occur. Besides, by 
introducing this upgraded security system, the time spent lining up at the guard house to verify 
the identity of the residents by using access cards can be reduced. The efficiency of identity 
verification can also be boosted. At the same time, the safety of the residents can be protected 
with tighter security. Meanwhile, the modules that will be developed in this system are face 
recognition module, car plate module, residents module, and visitors module. 
In the face recognition module, residents' faces will be registered as the authorised user 
of the system and will be able to go in and out of the residential area by scanning their faces 
on the screen. Moreover, the car plate module does the same thing as the face recognition 
module, the only difference is that it detects whether the car plate of the car driven by the 
resident is registered into the system. Besides, the details of residents will be included under 
the residents module. Meanwhile, the visitors module will have the visitors details inserted by 
respective residents.
